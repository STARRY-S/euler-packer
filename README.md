# Packer Build Scripts for openEuler

## Purpose

These scripts are used to create openEuler cloud image for AWS.

The generated AMI images can be found in `ap-northeast-1` (Tokyo) and `ca-central-1` (Canada) region.
You can edit the configuration files in [openeuler/aws/*.json](openeuler/aws/) to customize the region of the generated AMI images.

> AMI name begin with `DEV` is the "Base AMI Image" of openEuler, **this AMI image is not recommended to use in production**.
> AMI name without `DEV` is configured to install `cloud-init` and other packages, the installation script is [scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit](scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit)

## Usage

**Required OS**: Linux is recommended to run these scripts, MacOS and Windows are not supported since these scripts need to use `qemu-nbd` to load the partition in `qcow2` images onto system (for shrinking partition size) and `mount` the partitions (for install ENA kernel module).
The Linux distribution we use for developing this project is `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`, other distributions are not tested yet and may not working properly.

This project use `make` command to run scripts, you can run `make` command without parameter to get more information.

```text
Usage:
    make prep  -- Prepare AWS base AMI image.
    make build -- Create AMI image from base image by using packer.
    make clean -- Delete temporary files in 'tmp' folder.
```

1. Install build dependencies.

    - Ensure `make`, `docker`, `awscli`, `jq`, `qemu-utils`, `partprobe` and `fdisk` are installed.
    - Make sure AWS config file `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` are configured (generated by command `aws configure`).
    - Make sure  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable are configured.

    Here is the example installation command for Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    # Some packages may already installed before running this command
    sudo apt install make awscli jq qemu-utils partprobe fdisk
    ```

    Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) to install Docker.

    Then run following commands to configure AWS Client.

    ```sh
    # Generate ~/.aws/credential
    aws configure
    # Set environment variables
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key id>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret>
    ```

    Clone this project:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cnrancher/euler-packer.git && cd euler-packer
    ```

2. Preparation: `make prep`

    `make prep` command involves following operations:

    - Download openEuler qcow2 image and shrink its partition size to 8G, install ENA kernel module for aarch64 architecture.
    - Convert qcow2 image to RAW format.
    - Upload openEuler RAW image to AWS S3 bucket, then create snapshot from the RAW image uploaded to S3 bucket, then create base AMI image from this snapshot.

    ``` sh
    AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket_name> \
        OPENEULER_ARCH=<arch_name> \
        OPENEULER_VERSION=<version> \
        make prep
    ```

    Environment variables when executing `make prep`:

      - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`: AWS S3 bucket name, **required**
      - `OPENEULER_ARCH`: openEuler arch, default is `x86_64`, can be `x86_64` or `aarch64`
      - `OPENEULER_VERSION`: openEuler version, default is `22.03-LTS`

    After running `make prep`, you may find the generated "Base AMI image" with its name format `DEV-openEuler-<VERSION>-<ARCH>-<DATETIME>-BASE`

    > "Base AMI Image" simply built by shrinking the qcow2 partition size and convert it to RAW and upload it to S3 bucket and generated AMI from this RAW image stored in S3. This image does not have `cloud-init` installed and user can login to the instance by using the default root password of openEuler, so **this image is not safe and not recommended to use in production**.

3. Use packer to create AMI image from base AMI image: `make build`

    `make build` command involves following operations:

    - Use `packer` to launch an EC2 instance from "Base AMI image".
    - Install `cloud-init` and other useful tools, see [scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit](scripts/openeuler-install-cloudinit).
    - Finally convert the EBS of the instance to AWS Snapshot, and generate AMI image from it.
    - All operations above are automatically executed by `packer`.

    ``` sh
    OPENEULER_VERSION=<version> \
        AWS_BASE_AMI=<base_ami_id> \
        OPENEULER_ARCH=<arch> \
        AWS_BASE_AMI_OWNER_ID=<ower_id> \
        make build
    ```

    Environment variables when executin `make build`:

      - `OPENEULER_VERSION`: openEuler version, default is `22.03-LTS`
      - `AWS_BASE_AMI`: base AMI ID, required if not executed `make prep`
        This script can load base AMI ID from the output of command `make prep`, **so this parameter is not force required if you run `make prep` before `make build`**.
      - `OPENEULER_ARCH`: openEuler arch, default is `x86_64`, can be `x86_64` or `aarch64`.
      - `AWS_BASE_AMI_OWNER_ID`: The owner ID of the base AMI image, you can find this ID from AWS console panel, **this variable is force required**.

4. Finally packer will create an AMI image with its name format `openEuler-<VERSION>-<ARCH>-hvm-<DATETIME>`.

## Others

- If `make prep` failed when trying to download/uncompress `qcow.xz` archive file, run `make clean` before re-run `make prep`.

- If `make prep` failed when resizing partition size, and `/dev/nbd0` is loaded on your system, run following command before re-run `make-prep`:

    ``` sh
    sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
    ```

- `make prep` make fail when shirinking partition size, with error message `run 'e2fsck -f /dev/nbd0p2' first` or device is busy etc... Run following command and try to re-run `make prep` again.

    ```
    # If the error message is about 'e2fsck', run:
    sudo e2fsck -f /dev/nbd0p2

    # If the error message is about 'device busy', run:
    sudo partprobe /dev/nbd0
    ```

- Currently openEuler aarch64 does not have [ENA](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/tree/master/kernel/linux/ena) driver installed in kernel, this project use a workaround to download pre-build ENA kernel module and install into system when creating openEuler aarch64 RAW image.

    The ENA kernel module is installed in to `/opt/ena-driver/ena.ko`, and use `modprobe` to automatically load this kernel module when system start up. **Do not delete this file** or the EC2 instance won't connect to the internet!
